@samuelj29060 It is! Would've thought 1 of Man U or Arsenal would be on tonight as both are on TV tomorrow aren't they?
Got my tickets for #BHAFC's 4th round FA Cup tie at the Amex!! Find out tonight if its Arsenal or Swansea we're up against!
RT @WSTalbs: If any Arsenal fans give you grief after our inevitable loss on Sunday, just show then this. Worked for me last night! http ...
How did we not win that?  We'd be good if we could score!  But, at least we equalised so weekend not ruined.  Away to Arsenal on Wednesday.
Yeah I am going to Arsenal v Swansea tomorrow
#Football: Live FA Cup 3rd Round Replays on January 16 - Man Utd v West Ham on ITV, Arsenal v Swansea on ESPN: http://t.co/guz3Lu3c
Big match at Emirates tomorrow; I hope Arsenal will go through.
Arsenal fans have hope, saints gave Chelsea a 2 goal lead on Wednesday night and still got a valuable point :D
Off to Arsenal tomorrow night, see some of their #fanengagement in action.
@MiguelDelaney he was absolutely fantastic tonight, a joy to watch. Showed similar drive in 2nd half v City, the only one from Arsenal.
Thought we were gonna win looooool oh well. Play 90 minutes like the second half wednesday, Arsenal
Should have won today's match. Can't believe we let a 2-0 lead slip. Important points dropped. Must win against Arsenal on Sunday now.
Gotta wrap up for Arsenal tomorrow... Think my Wenger coat has to come out!
RT @JoshWHUFC: God I hate Arsenal fans! Can't wait to go turn them over next Wednesday! #AwayDays
@CavortingCraigo no pal too late notice to get it off work at arsenal and Fulham though, you going tomorrow?
